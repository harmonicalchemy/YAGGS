! OK you asked for some news? Here you go... **_(evil grin)_**

## Strange Anomalous Events shortly after Thunderstorm at Mountain Resort.
Residents of a small mountain resort located near Mystery Lake Montana have been experiencing strange anomalous events that first began appearing shortly after a strange out of season thunderstorm occurred two weeks ago.

===

Many residents were reported missing on the first day and are still at large.  Others have been experiencing strange dreams periodically in the mornings and evenings.  Some residents report seeing ghosts or beings of light floating about the grounds outside.. Most residents report electrical appliances, TVs, Radios, computers, have all been experiencing strange glitches.

The local Sheriff reported earlier in the week that a team of government specialists were on the scene investigating all these physical and mental anomalies.  However this morning the Sheriff rescinded is first statement explaining it was based on a rumour.

The official word from the science team, published in the local paper this morning, states:

> "We are scientist from the EPA here to study the unseasonable weather only.  Although our instruments are designed to study only weather, we have found no electromagnetic or weather data related evidence from our tests that suggest any of the rumours have any merit. Failing electronics after a strong electrical storm is a common thing, especially if not surge protected.  The missing residents issue has to be a coincidence not related to the storm.  Please report any information or questions about any of the missing persons to the local Sheriff.  We are scientist, not law enforcement."

Later the Sheriff admitted that he had called the FBI for assistance a couple days ago. He said "An FBI agent is expected to arrive any day now who will be assisting me with ongoing investigations of the missing persons. This investigation is completely separate from anything the weather scientist are doing."

Town's folk are very alarmed however. A few claim they had evidence/photos but when the investigators arrived all their data mysteriously disappeared!  Two individuals _(who have asked not to be identified)_ say "The whole thing is a secret government project gone wrong and they are now covering up their tracks!
