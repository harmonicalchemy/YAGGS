## About this video clip:

**Anna Christie** is a 1930 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film adaptation of the 1922 play of the same name by Eugene O'Neill. The film was adapted by Frances Marion, produced and directed by Clarence Brown with Paul Bern and Irving Thalberg as co-producers. Cinematography by William H. Daniels, art direction by Cedric Gibbons and costume design by Adrian.

This **_early b/w "talkie"_** was marketed using the slogan "Garbo Talks!", because it was her first talkie, and she does a brilliant job of it!  You would never guess Greta was born in Sweden as: **Greta Lovisa Gustafsson**!  She was so good at creating accents and characterisations that you forget it is acting and fall right into the thick of it as if you were really there watching real people!  Greta shared these larger-than-life drama skills of the big screen with 4 others of equal calibre in Hollywood: Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Audrey Hepburn and Ingrid Bergman.  All 5 of these women have been a huge inspiration for me in my life!

The film was nominated three Academy Awards for: Best Actress (Greta Garbo), Best Cinematography (William H. Daniels, and Best Director (Clarence Brown).

This is one of my favourite performances of Greta Garbo...  I love her style and attitude here.  her character, Anna, is not afraid of men at all!  I would have loved it if she had also played Anna's role in the Broadway play only two years after women were allowed to vote in the USA. Even so, the Women's Suffrage movement was still struggling ten years later! It took a lot of guts for a woman to stand up to men back then... and in truth, women are still considered second citizens by many men even today!  **_"I know what your thinking... You're just like all the rest"_** she says in her monologue during the film. So true!
